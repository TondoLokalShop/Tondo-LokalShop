            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>  The Tondo Lokal Clothing Shop opened its doors in August 2021 and comprises three merged brands: ViceVersa Apparel (VVA), Money Drudgery Clothing (MDC), and Brand New With Tag Clothing (BNWT). The owners of this business are friends who share a passion for editing and design, particularly adoring clothing that embodies fashion. They opened their store in a vape shop because one of the owners had a vape shop. There used to be a clothes store, and when they hung out there, they came up with the concept of co-clothing.
                 Each of the three pals has unique capabilities; one is famous and influential in Tondo Manila, one is skilled at designing or editing, and the last one has a shop.
                
                <br><br>
                The three friends pushed to expand their business and dreamed of becoming the top clothing seller in Tondo Manila since they knew a wide range of circles of friends who would support them. This gave them confidence in doing business.
